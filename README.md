# n0calc

n0calc is extremely simple but handy GUI calculator. It was created just for fun and improving my GUI creation skills. Used toolkit - GTK3 (probably compatiable with GTK2).

'=' button evaluates expression at specified format:

`operand1*operand2`

where * is operator, can be '+', '-', '*', '/', operand1 and operand2 are operands.

Keyboard is supported. Wrong and incompatiable expressions are handled with informative error message. Round brackets, ^ operator, and other stuff are not supported. White spaces normalization will be added soon.
